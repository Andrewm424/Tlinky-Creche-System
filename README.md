# Tlinky-Creche-System
A community-driven full-stack system developed as part of the Work Integrated Learning 3 (XADAD7112/w) module at Rosebank College (IIE). This project was created to assist Tlinky Crèche, a childcare center in Midrand, with modernising its paper-based administration by providing an integrated web portal and mobile app.
